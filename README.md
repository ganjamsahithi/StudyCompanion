#Project Description
Agent Compass is an AI-powered academic assistant designed to help college students manage their studies more effectively. This agent goes beyond a regular chatbot by acting as a proactive companion, helping you manage notes, track assignments, and receive personalized study recommendations.

Since it doesn't rely on a specific Learning Management System (LMS), it works directly with your personal files and notes. This makes it a versatile and private tool for anyone looking to organize their academic life.

Features (Initial MVP)
Document Summarization: Upload lecture notes, articles, or other PDFs and get concise, easy-to-digest summaries. This helps you quickly review material and grasp key concepts.

Basic Task Management: Manually add assignments, projects, and exam deadlines to a personalized to-do list. The agent helps you keep track of what's due and when.

Targeted Resource Suggestions: Based on the content you provide, the agent can suggest relevant external resources like YouTube videos, practice problems, or research papers to help you deepen your understanding.

How It Works
You Provide the Data: Instead of pulling from a university system, you upload your personal documents and enter your assignment details.

The AI Processes: The agent uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze your files. It identifies key concepts, summarizes text, and extracts important information like due dates.

It Offers Support: The agent then uses this processed information to provide you with summaries, timely reminders, and tailored suggestions to help you stay on top of your work and improve your learning.
